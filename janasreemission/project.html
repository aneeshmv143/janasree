			<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p><h3>Following projects are currently being implemented</h3>
				<h5>Toxin Free Food Production</h5></p>
					<p align="justify">JSDM has taken strides in moving towards the dream of self sustainability in food crops with focus on toxin free methods for Kerala. During the year 2011-12 a total of 783 Janasree groups in Kerala have initiated group farming of vegetables and plantain in land area varying from 1 to 4 hectors. In 73000 families we have facilitated cultivation of vegetables in the available land. In this process a total of 7800 ha land which was kept uncultivated has been turned in to food crop cultivating areas.</p>
				<h5>Jaivasree Project</h5>
                    			<p align="justify">JSDM has launched this unique project during the Jaivasree festival of 2011 at Trivandrum. The project is expected to be undertaken in partnership with Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, MKSP, Horticultural Mission, Agriculture Department, State Bank of Travancore,  Jaivasree Toxin Free Food Products and Producers Company and other likely minded organisations. Project envisages transforming Kerala in to self sustainability in food crop cultivation within a span of 5 years.</p>

Exhibition focussed on organic products, cultivation practices and equipments. In 2011 a total of 230000 people attended the programme. Seminar and discussions on various issues relating to food security and toxin free cultivation practices is also organised as part of the festival. </p>
				<h5>Gender Equity Programme</h5>
                    			<p align="justify"> As an initiative to facilitate discussion on gender sensitive development approach as well as to facilitate an action research on gender aware approach in development initiatives, JSDM has started a gender mission under the directorship of Dr. Gita Gopal.

					<li style="font-size:14px;">An action research involving 50000 thousand SHGs over a period of 5 years to assess the impact of development initiatives already initiated by government and non-government actors. Already developed monitoring framework will be used for action research.</li><br>

                <h5>Consumer Awareness programmes</h5>

                    <p align="justify">Kerala being a prominent consumer state awareness and action regarding the rights of consumer, remedial mechanisms established by government and other agencies, process for grievance redressal measures etc is important.
